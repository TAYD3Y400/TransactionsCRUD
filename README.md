# TransactionsCRUD

This project is for learning purposes in .NET Core MVC and reviewing CSS.

It is a simple CRUD for bank transactions, with an Index view and an AddOrEdit view.

In the Index view, you can delete or edit transactions, as well as add new transactions.

## It is connected to SQL Server, so you need to do the following injection:

* set "ConnectionStrings" at appsettings.json
* Build solution
* Package Manager Console
* Add-Migration "message"
* Update-Databas
